      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>At PurPaws, our mission is simple: to create a world where every pet has a safe, loving, and permanent home. We believe that the bond between a pet and a person is a special one, and we are dedicated to facilitating that connection. We built this platform to bridge the gap between lost pets and their worried owners, and to give unclaimed animals a second chance at a happy life through adoption.</p>

        <h3>2. Community Network</h3>
        <p>Our platform acts as a digital neighborhood watch, connecting people in the same area. Users can view lost and found reports to help identify and locate pets.</p>

        <h3>3. A Second Chance</h3>
        <p>Found pets that remain unclaimed after a certain period are given a new opportunity. Our dedicated admins review their cases and list them for adoption, ensuring they can find a new forever home.</p>
